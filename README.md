<HTML><h3>Terms and Conditions for using Snow Algae Model:</h3>

<BIG><B><U>A user must agree to following terms and conditions before usage.</U></B></BIG>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Snow Algae Model is 1-D Numerical model for predicting snow algal growth using meteorological and snow physical conditions (Onuma et al., 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022). The latest version of Snow Algae Model has been incorporated into a land surface model MATSIRO6 established by Japanese modelling community in order to quantify spatio-temporal change in snow algal abundance globally (Onuma et al., 2022). Snow Algae Model is made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights. The availability of Snow Algae Model does not constitute publication of the model. We rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to assure that Yukihiko Onuma (YO hereafter) receives fair credit for our work. If Snow Algae Model are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, YO should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work. If Snow Algae Model are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on the model, co-authorship may be appropriate. This should be discussed at an early stage in the work. Manuscripts using Snow Algae Model should be sent to YO for review before they are submitted for publication so that it can be insured that the quality and limitations of Snow Algae Model are accurately represented.</P>

<br><B><VAR>-XMD</B> : Variable simulated using a Snow Algae Model described in Onuma et al. (2022). In the XMD model, snow algal abundance increases with snow melting on the surface snow under day-light condition. The abundance can increases until reaching to  the carrying capacity.
<br><B><VAR>-XMDF</B> : Variable simulated using a Snow Algae Model described in Onuma et al. (2022). In the XMD model, snow algal abundance increases with snow melting on the surface snow under day-light condition and decreases with snowfall amount.
